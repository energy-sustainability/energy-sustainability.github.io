This page contains the guided laboratory of the Embedding Spaces topic for the Deep Learning course at the Master in Artificial Inteligence of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya.

The codes introduced in this guided lab can be found [here](https://github.com/UPC-MAI-DL/UPC-MAI-DL.github.io/tree/master/_codes/3.Embeddings)

Some necessary resources are found within gpfs. This must be copied to your local .keras/models folder. Their location is:
